# Forge Demo - DEPRECATED

> **This repository is deprecated.** Forge is now a single product with all 173 functions.

## Moved to [royalbit/forge](https://github.com/royalbit/forge)

The demo/enterprise split has been removed. There is now one Forge:

- **173 functions** (Excel-compatible + 6 FP&A-native)
- **Elastic License 2.0** (source-available)
- **Free for evaluation** (non-production use)

## Migration

```bash
# Instead of forge-demo, use forge
cargo install royalbit-forge

# Same commands, all features
forge calculate model.yaml
forge export model.yaml --output model.xlsx
```
