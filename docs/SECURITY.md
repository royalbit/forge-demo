# Security

Forge is designed with security and privacy as core principles.

## 100% Local

- **No cloud** - Forge runs entirely on your machine
- **No telemetry** - Zero data collection, zero phone-home
- **No network** - Works completely offline
- **No accounts** - No registration, no login

Your financial models never leave your computer.

## Deterministic

- **Same input = same output** - Always
- **No randomness** - Reproducible calculations
- **No external dependencies** - Self-contained binary

## Auditable

- **YAML is human-readable** - Anyone can review models
- **Git-native** - Full version history of changes
- **No hidden state** - What you see is what you get
- **Formula transparency** - Every calculation is visible

## Data Handling

- **Files stay local** - Forge only reads files you specify
- **No temp files** - No data written outside your project
- **No caching** - Each run is fresh

## Binary Distribution

- **Signed binaries** - Verified source
- **SHA256 checksums** - Integrity verification
- **No installer** - Single executable, no system modifications

## Enterprise Compliance

Forge is suitable for environments requiring:

- **SOC 2** - No data leaves the organization
